# Brief
- English | [简体中文](./README-CN.md)
- A Unity entry to develop 2D games, for this reason I want to record these entry techniques to better learn and read, and also facilitate subsequent rapid learning and memory.  
- The idea is to write it in the form of a table of contents, and different chapters correspond to different articles, which is conducive to quick search and reading, and saves the time of repeatedly watching videos.
- Everything is for better growth and learning!

# Notice
It is better to watch the original video about the [installation of the Unity environment](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1W4411Z7UC/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=dc445fb4e41d3de7de2083486278c58b) and [the packaging and release of the final game](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17E411X7Ss/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=dc445fb4e41d3de7de2083486278c58b).
# Special thanks
Thank you very much for the video tutorial of [Mike](https://space.bilibili.com/370283072), he gave me a lot of help, and then I learned about different languages and interesting technologies of the Unity game engine and the development method different from the Unreal engine, which made me very happy to enter the door of Unity game development !
